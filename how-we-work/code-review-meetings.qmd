title: "Code review meetings"
---

This meeting type is to go over and discuss code if any team
member has anything to discuss, share, or need help with making a
decision. Specifically when it comes to something added in a pull request.
The pull request can be in a draft format and doesn't need to be completed.

During this meeting, we'll try limit the time to \~30 minutes and *at
most* review two pull requests.

More details about this type of meeting will be added as we practice and
do them.
