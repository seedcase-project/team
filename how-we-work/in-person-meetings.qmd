title: "In-person meetings"
---

We are a remote-first group, but we value the in-person time as an
opportunity for brainstorming
and planning, and to get to know one another better through informal social activities.

We plan on doing them approximately every 6 months, but we don't have a
fixed date for them. If there is a conference or other event that most
of us want to attend, we will plan the in-person time around that
event. Otherwise, we will pick a time that works for most people,
usually around April/May and October/November.

During the in-person time, we agree that we prioritise these
types of activities in the following order:

- Social activities to strengthen our relationships and get to know one
  another a bit more outside of a work context. This means that we don't do
  work related activities during these times. These activities can be
  dinners, going to museums, doing escape rooms, or other fun and informal activities.
  The team lead is responsible for booking and planning these
  activities, though everyone gives their input on what they would like
  to do and what they think would be fun.

- Intensive brainstorming, eventstorming, and/or planning sessions.
  These types of sessions work best with in-person interaction because
  the questioning, discussing, and deciding feedback loop is much
  faster. These benefit from having a clear agenda beforehand, which is
  the responsibility of the team lead to prepare and share with the team
  before the in-person time.
