title: "Time-constrained iterative workflow"
---

We take inspiration from some aspects of [Agile Software
Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and
[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module), especially
this idea of time-boxed periods ("iterations") of work that follow a
specific pattern and process for incrementally building or improving
things. The reason we don't completely use Agile or Scrum workflows is
because these workflows generally don't fit well in more academic and
research environments. Scrum and Agile often assumes that:

-   We are in a more traditional "business" environment with customers
-   Everyone on the team is working only on the project, full-time and
    completely during the iteration (e.g. with the use of "daily
    standups"),
-   Everyone on the team is highly technically skilled and knowledgeable
    in software development practices (e.g. with the "self-organizing"
    principle)
-   We have the resources to have dedicated personnel for managing the
    iteration and planning the product (e.g. with "Scrum Master" and
    "Product Owner")

However, often in academic and research settings, these assumptions are
not relevant or applicable. For instance, often everyone is or may be
involved in multiple projects. Or we have a broad and diverse range in
technical skills around software development practices, often because
research and academic environments don't foster nor support nor are
aware of these types of skills and knowledge. All of these impact how
effective an Agile or Scrum workflow are in these environments.

Based on these inspirations, an iteration for us follows a general
sequence of steps.

## Future iteration planning

Team lead sets everything up for the next two or three iterations.

-   Will create an iteration within the main "Team project planning"
    board (which are all listed
    [here](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/), which is
    found in the Settings in the board.
-   Will write the title of the iteration as the goal for it, while
    keeping the goal focused, small, achievable, and considerate of the
    time we have available.
-   Will add the main tasks to achieve the iteration goal to the board.
-   Will plan iterations so that they either end on a major holiday or
    are right in the middle of it. If possible, don't plan the start of
    iterations a few days before major holidays start.
-   Will plan and decide on how long the future iterations should be
    (can range from 2-6 weeks, but prefer shorter iterations over longer
    ones). So far, we find that 3 week iterations work the best.

## Start of iteration

::: callout-important
We track our iterations' progress and tasks on GitHub with [this project
board](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/18/).
:::

An iteration starts with a first planning meeting that is scheduled well
in advance, for between 30-45 minutes and either right after the
previous iteration's debrief and retrospective or in the morning of the
next day (to give a bit of break between meetings). Preferably this
meeting is in person. The aim of the meeting to discuss and plan the
specifics of the iteration.

::: callout-note
A basic agenda for the meeting might be:

-   Assign a timekeeper.
-   Review and agree on the iteration aim and end date.
-   Review the list of tasks already listed.
-   Brainstorm and add any other issues as needed.
-   Schedule the next iteration's end and start meetings.

### Before meeting

In general, only the team lead is required to prepare for the planning
meeting. Before the planning meeting, the team lead will move any
existing tasks (GitHub Issues) into the iteration that is relevant to
the aim of the iteration. The team lead will also create any issues that
are missing from the current list of issues. While making issues, keep
them as small as is reasonable and as descriptive and targeted as
possible.

Other team members can optionally review the aim and output of the
iteration board, review the list of issues already listed, and write out
any potential issues as needed to complete the iteration aim.

### During meeting

During the meeting, someone will share their screen (if virtual) and the
team goes through the tasks on the board together. We'll discuss and
decide or agree on the iteration goal (the "increment" or "milestone")
and the end date.

We'll review the current list of tasks on the board, brainstorm any
other tasks that are needed, We'll then agree on the number of tasks in
the iteration as well as the distribution of priority labels of the
tasks.

Then, we agree on and schedule the end date debrief and retrospective
meeting, which should be approximately 2-3 hours and preferably before
lunch, as well as the next iterations planning meeting. The next
planning meeting should either be on the same date after lunch, to
ensure a proper break before moving to a new iteration, or the next day
to give some break between meetings.

## During the iteration

We have a [guide](iteration-tasks.qmd) that describes in detail how we
work on tasks during an iteration.

## End of iteration

::: callout-important
We track our iterations' progress and tasks on GitHub with [this project
board](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/18/).
:::

The iteration's end is a last meeting for a debrief and retrospective to
discuss how things went. These are between 1-2 hours and are preferably
in person. The time and place of this meeting will have been scheduled
during the planning meeting.

::: callout-note
A basic agenda is:

-   Assign timekeeper.
-   Demo (internally or externally) the progress of the iteration.
-   Evaluate the iteration aim.
-   Go over what we accomplished and how we felt we did (including
    struggles).
-   Do a retrospective.
:::

During the debrief and retrospective meeting, we will:

-   Assign a timekeeper to keep us on track and so we avoid spending too
    long on any one topic.
-   Show off and (optionally) demo the output of the iteration all
    together as a team. We'll assign someone to be responsible for
    showing or trying out the demo before the meeting.
-   (Optionally done occasionally, but strongly suggested) Include
    someone external (a potential user) to try out the product/demo and
    give some feedback.
-   Evaluate the aim and review whether we've achieved the aim.
-   Briefly go over what we each did during the iteration and how we
    felt we did. Include any barriers, struggles, or challenges that
    came up during the iteration here.
-   Do a "retrospective", where we individually write down how things
    went ("keep doing" category) and what could be improved or removed
    ("stop doing/improve on" category) in the process. The retrospective
    should ideally be done in a collaborative "note-taking/post-it
    notes" system ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is really nice for
    this). These notes will be collected into topics and we will add
    action items to each of the topics. The team lead will add these
    action items to issues or posts on how we work.
