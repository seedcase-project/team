title: "Tasks during iterations"

While specific details about what we do during an iteration is described
in the [iteration](iteration.qmd) guide, there are some speific
situations that need a bit more detail.

In general, tasks we work on during the iteration should support the
overall iteration goal. However, there are several cases when we should
work on tasks unrelated to the goal of the current iteration. Specifically:

-   Whenever a decision is made, create a decision post about it as near
    to the time of decision as possible (or before making the decision).
-   Whenever a team member learns something and feels like it would be
    useful to share with the team, create a learning post about it as
    near to the time of learning as possible.
-   If tasks from the previous iteration are "In Progress" or "In Review" 
    at the beginning of a new iteration and it makes sense to finish it 
    during the next iteration.

Likewise, while issues are assigned a priority, our individual and team
priorities are to, in order:

-   Respond to reviewer comments on our own pull requests.
-   Respond to issues where we are tagged/mentioned (`@`).
-   Review pull requests from others.
-   Work on the assigned highest priority issues.
-   Respond to comments and questions in issues, unless it is a
    discussion issue, where the assigned team member will seek out and
    request our comments.
