## GenomeDK

[GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk) is the name of Aarhus University's
super computer cluster. It is a high-performance computing (HPC) system.
It is ISO 27001 certified and approved to store sensitive data in
compliance with GDPR and the Danish Data Protection Act.

Within a Seedcase context we are going to use it as an example of how
Sprout can be used to import, organise and store data on a remote
cluster. It will also be used by the two projects that we are currently
working with, DP Next and OnLimit.

## Access

Anyone can ask for an account on GenomeDK. This is done through a web
form which then goes to be manually assessed and processed. There is a
slight niggle with the form at present, as it isn't clear that you need
to state your preferred username and password, and not only complete the
section if you are wanting to re-activate an old account.

## Setting up

Once you get approved for access you can run through the
[documentation](https://genome.au.dk/docs/), which is extensive and
quite detailed. You should be familiar with using a Shell and
manipulating shell scripts, you should also be ready to set up
two-factor authentication using an authenticator app (they don't
stipulate any in particular).

## Desktop versus SSH

In Seedcase we expect that we will primarily be working with an SSH
connection in VS Code, this can be set up quite easily, and the guidance
on how to set up a public key to make connection easier is simple and
easy to follow. There is also a remote desktop solution which recently
(spring 2025) launched, this looks promising, but isn't a current
priority for us.
