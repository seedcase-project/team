title: Creating PlantUML images
date: last-modified
---

We use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) to create diagrams across most of content, such as:

1. [C4 diagrams](https://c4model.com) to visualise the software architecture.
2. [Sequence diagrams](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) that visualise how and in what order things work together.

To create PNG images of the PlantUML files, open a Terminal while inside the
project that has the PlantUML files and that has the `justfile`, and run the
command:

``` bash
just generate-puml-all
```

If you want to generate a specific image, run:

``` bash
just generate-puml PATH/TO/PUML
```

You need to have both Docker and Just installed and have Docker running in the
background in order for these commands to work. To see how to install these
programs, check out the entry on [software](software.qmd)) for more details.
