title: Creating PlantUML images
date: last-modified
---

We use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) to create diagrams across most of content, such as:

1. [C4 diagrams](https://c4model.com) to visualise the software architecture.
2. [Sequence diagrams](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) that visualise how and in what order things work together.

To create PNG images of the PlantUML files, open a Terminal while inside the
project that has the PlantUML files and that has the `justfile`, and run the
command:

``` bash
just generate-puml-all
```

If you want to generate a specific image, run:

``` bash
just generate-puml PATH/TO/PUML
```

## Seedcase theme

We have created a PlantUML theme that we use across all our PlantUML
diagrams. This theme is located in the
[`seedcase-theme`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-theme)
repository and is synced to the remaining Seedcase repositories. In
these repositories, the theme is located in the
`_extensions/seedcase-project/seedcase-theme` directory.

To include the theme in a PlantUML file, add the following line at the
top of the file:

``` bash
@startuml diagram-name

!theme seedcase from ../_extensions/seedcase-project/seedcase-theme

[add your diagram code here] 

@enduml
```

Note that depending on the location of your `.puml` file, you might need
to adjust the path above, so that it points to the correct location of
the theme. The script above assumes that the PlantUML file is located in
a subdirectory one level below the root of the repository.
