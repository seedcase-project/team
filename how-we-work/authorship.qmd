title: "Handling authorship"
---

We've agreed that inclusion as an author in the e.g. `CITATION.cff` or
`.zenodo.json` files in a repository is based on the following criteria:

1. If they are part of Seedcase *and* they've directly contributed to
   the repository through a pull request, then they are added as an
   author.
2. If they are not part of Seedcase, they must have contributed to the
   repository through a pull request at least a few times, on a regular
   and longer-term basis, and have contributed outside of pull requests,
   e.g. in discussions on issues, in order to be added as authors.

Included authors are listed in alphabetical order by last name.
