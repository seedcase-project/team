title: "Handling authorship"
---

We've agreed that the way we formally decide someone is put as an author
in the e.g. `CITATION.cff` or `.zenodo.json` files is based on these
criteria:

1.  If they are part of Seedcase *and* they've directly contributed to
    the repository through a pull request, then they are added as an
    author.
2.  If they are not part of Seedcase, they must have contributed to the
    repository through a pull request at least a few times, on a regular
    and longer-term basis, and have contributed outside of pull
    requests, e.g. in discussions on issues, in order to be added as
    authors.

For listing authors, we list them in alphabetical order by last name.
