## Agenda details

We can discuss or ask questions anytime throughout the 2 days. They can
be on topic or off topic :smile:

### Onboarding session {#onboarding}

For project:

-   Overview of SDCA:
    -   [Main Steno website](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research)
    -   [Common Docs](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/)
-   Overview of project:
    -   [GitHub
        repository](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/dif-project/)
    -   [Website](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/)
-   Expectations:
    -   Autonomy, flexibility in work and hours
    -   Any side projects or other activities, maybe we can incorporate
        or help out
-   Tools critical to project:
    -   Necessary for project: Git, GitHub, git branch-based workflow,
        Quarto, Markdown
    -   Brainstorm later on for other necessary tools for whole team
        (e.g. communication)

### Social activities {#social-activities}

-   Walk around the area
-   Things to chat about:
    -   Things you'd like to learn while in this job/project
    -   How do you work best?
    -   Things learned from previous positions that worked well or could
        be improved on

### Working together session {#working-together}

-   CONTRIBUTING
    -   Git branch-based workflow (GitHub)
    -   When do we work synchronously together and how often
-   GOVERNANCE
    -   How does overall decision making and responsibility structure
        look like? To communicate to others outside team how we do
        things. For instance, while I'm in general responsible for
        overall plan and structure of project, others can also be
        involved in decisions since those contributing also have a stake
        in the project.
-   CODE OF CONDUCT
    -   How do we want to work together and behave?
    -   How to resolve conflicts?
-   Tools to communicate with each other or for project management
    -   Which communication channels? (Discord/Slack/Zoom/etc)
    -   What tools to use to manage project? GitHub issues/board?
        Trello?

### Sharing knowledge and skills {#sharing}

-   How to share what we already know and what we learn?
    -   For those inside and outside the team?
    -   As blog posts? So we can eventually combine them into formal
        teaching material or some other documentation later?
    -   Other forms of dissemination?

### Project specific brainstorming {#project-brainstorming}

-   Delegating/assigning tasks and next steps
-   Brainstorm potential names for project (other than DIF) \[#\]
-   Do we make a new GitHub organization or use steno-aarhus?

### Next steps {#next-steps}

-   Next (virtual) session:
    -   Brainstorming architecture/design, list of tasks/milestones and
        who does what
    -   Scheduling next session

## Questions to address from meeting

-   Potential name for the product?

## Minutes from meeting
