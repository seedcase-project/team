# Agenda

1.  How to work together effectively and optimally
    -   CONTRIBUTING
        -   Workflow (Github)
        -   When we work together, how often
        -   Which communication channels? (Discord/Slack/Zoom/etc)
    -   GOVERNANCE
        -   e.g. in general I'm responsible for overall plan and
            structure of project but that doesn't mean others don't get
            decision. We work as a team, each with areas of
            responsibilities but we all have a stake in this.
    -   CODE OF CONDUCT
        -   How do we want to work together and behave.
        -   How to resolve conflict.
2.  How to share knowledge and skills learned and experiences (inside
    and outside of team) (-docs)
    -   blog/\*
3.  Design, architecture, and technologies (-docs)
    -   design.md
    -   architecture/api.md
        -   decisions/why-rest-api.md
        -   decisions/why-django-or-flask.md
    -   architecture/backend.md
        -   decisions/why-sqlite-or-parquet.md
    -   architecture/frontend.md
        -   decisions/why-...
