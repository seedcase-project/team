## Sessions

### Overview and discussion of the strategy, roadmap, and collaborations

Review the overall strategy and roadmap again, especially in the context
of our collaborations with ON-LiMiT and DP-Next as well as having Joel
with us. We'll make sure we're all aligned in understanding what we want
and hope to achieve in the next few months. We'll also talk about the
different "roles" and teams we have currently as well as in the future.
Especially we'll want to discuss how to prioritise effectively.

While this session is more informal, this is the general agenda:

-   Review/revisit strategy and roadmap.
-   Review tasks and projects in ON-LiMiT, including current
    repositories, work, and boards.
-   Review DP-Next, including repositories and GitHub, as well as
    potential/expected projects and tasks.
-   Share what we all would like to work on (mostly to hear from Joel).
-   Align what we want to work on and prioritise over the next \~6
    months.
-   Review [team design
    principles](https://design.seedcase-project.org/organisation/teams),
    as well as Team Topologies.
-   Discuss what teams we'll have, our roles in them, and how we'd like
    to work together with them.

### Lightning rounds to share tools and tips

-   **Luke**: Using [`gh dash`](https://gh-dash.dev), a GitHub CLI
    extension, to list PRs to review, approve, merge and so on, all from
    the CLI.

-   **Joel**: Walk through what is Vim, some basic keybindings, and how
    to use it in the Terminal or VS Code.

### A presentation on a structured approach to writing code for software and analyses

Luke will do this presentation that will last about 2 hrs and will
include lots of time for informal questions and discussions. We'll
advertise to and invite others to attend, so the presentation will be
targeted to a more general audience.

We'll cover a basic introduction to functional programming for doing
data analysis and building software. We'll go into the conceptual and
(simple) mathematical foundations of it in a programming
language-agnostic way. Then I'll show some examples in Python and R, as
well as how it might look in a stricter, more advanced language like
Rust.

Slides will be posted to the Community website (link will be added here
later).

### Introduction to Denmark Statistics work in DP-Next

Since we're collaborating with DP-Next on tooling and some of the data
side of things, the aim of this session is to provide information on
Denmark Statistics (DST), how it relates to work in DP-Next and to Steno
Aarhus in general, and how the Seedcase team would like to contribute in
this area.

This session will be a 2 hour meeting and will have the following
general agenda:

-   Luke: Introductions to this session, overall aim and desired
    outcomes.
-   Anders: Describing DST and demonstrating/showing how they organize
    their data (files, folders, format).
-   Luke: Explain what Parquet is, why it's great, and what problems it
    solves in DST.
-   Kasper and Marie: Sharing any updates on what Steno Aarhus wants to
    do in this area with registers.
-   Kasper/Marie/Anders?: Explaining how StatTransfer works, give a
    demonstration of it, and expected way of using it.
-   Luke: Give overview of my code/package, what it does, and how, then
    compare it to StatTransfer.

### Debrief from discussion meeting

This session is to debrief from our previous session, to get aligned
with each other and discuss and decide on next steps.
