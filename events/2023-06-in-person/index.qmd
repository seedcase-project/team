## Sessions

### Job candidates and hiring process

-   Go through candidates, discuss, and send out emails for interviews.

### Working with consulting company

-   Details on what our original plan was for consulting company, what
    they can actually provide and do.
-   Brainstorm what we want the company to do, how we can best use their
    expertise and time, and how we can coordinate working with them.
-   Plan out priorities to discuss with them for next meeting with them.

### Next steps, barriers, and other items

-   General update on progress and bigger picture items.
-   What are some things we need to improve on?
-   Any areas of struggle or barriers to progress?
-   Next steps, areas of focus.
-   **Optional tasks**:
    -   Split up seedcase main project into sub websites? E.g. design,
        community, learn, etc?
    -   Move project over into rostools or create whole new
        organization? Or stay with SDCA organization?
    -   Review several "Discussion" labelled issues on repositories.
    -   Brainstorm logo! :grin:

### Cross-Steno contributions

-   Brainstorm what we can offer and what we can provide
    -   For instance, helping build software/organization to streamline
        work, running short workshops, etc.
-   Create a plan for organizing getting started, mapping out
    people/roles, coordinating dates for further brainstorming meetings,
    etc.

## Minutes

### Interviews and hiring

-   Went through candidates and started process towards interviewing.

### Consulting company

-   Areas we'd like help in:
    -   Security
    -   General/initial setup for best practices
    -   General review of design/architecture
-   Ideas on how often to work, when, and for how long? **Ultimately
    depends on our discussion with them during a
    "introduction/brainstorming" workshop**, where we will negotiate and
    decide on what works best for everyone.
    -   Maybe 2 days a week? Tue-Wed?
        -   If this weekday setup, we should move meetings to Wed
            afternoon.
    -   Go in 6 months intervals? First phase would be for design and
        getting set up, second would be focused on security and testing,
        final maybe focusing on frontend/UI/UX?
    -   Should of course be comfortable with English and working
        remotely.

### Next steps

-   Areas of improvements:
    -   Code reviews:
        -   For bigger PRs, the submitter should schedule time with
            someone else on the team for a virtual review to go through
            the PR verbally, so we can move those PRs through sooner.
        -   For smaller PRs, a simple visual/asynch review will work
            fine.
        -   For commit messages, have more detailed, descriptive
            messages, especially emphasizing the why, not just the what.
            Better yet is to reference an individual issue.
        -   Include more documentation on the functions/code created.
            For external facing code, include a complete docstring. For
            internal code, write code in a descriptive enough way,
            supplement with detailed enough comments, with a "top-level"
            comment describing the basic purpose, type of input, and
            type of output.
    -   **Action**: Luke to put these into the contributing
        document.
    -   For meetings:
        -   Use a template to cover some basic things that each person
            covers, in 5 minutes or less.
        -   Use "scrum standups" as inspiration.
        -   **Action**: Luke will create templates we can follow.
-   Struggles and barriers:
    -   What is the general design for the common data model?
    -   Using GitHub and Git
        -   Potential solution for this is create some workshops on
            using Git and GitHub. One for the basics and another for use
            in collaboration settings.
        -   **Action**: Luke create two new repos on the
            steno-aarhus account with basic setup for how it will look.
        -   **Action**: Kris organize times with other Steno people
            (Julie) on creating these workshops.
-   Misc:
    -   Got domain name (`seedcase-project.org`) as well as a `.dk`
        version.
    -   Ideas on general theme of websites:
        -   A light, soft blue/teal/green colour, to match idea of
            Seedcase.
        -   Colour blind friendly
        -   Simple and minimal
    -   Ideas on general theme of Seedcase Product UI:
        -   Create it so there are some default themes built-in, but
            that it can be easily customizable with Sass (`.scss`) or
            something similar.
    -   Logo, Kris started making some with Midjourney app, and made a
        basic draft of it.
    -   To fix on website: Community sidebar is weird and "View source"
        isn't on all pages.
    -   Splitting up repo contents (for seedcase website), others are
        neutral to the idea, might be good for admin/organizing though.
    -   Seedcase will eventually need involvement of IT department,
        since we will need a server to host the software.
        -   Kris will eventually be responsible for connecting with IT
            and coordinate things.
        -   We can use the experience to inform how to set things up
            with other IT departments in other organizations.

### Steno contributions

-   Start with brainstorming with Kasper on how we can help him out with
    his tasks
    -   Schedule brainstorming session to see what his day *actually*
        looks like, so we can identify sources of contribution.
-   Start bringing together people who work on data on the management
    side (not analysis side).
    -   **Action**: Kris to learn who is doing data management stuff
        and coordinate bringing them together.
    -   **Action**: Luke to start creating docs describing what we
        are doing and why we are doing it and how to go about it.
-   Start working more on the project listing/registration module of
    Seedcase, since others at Steno could benefit from that a lot. Would
    be a nice "showcase" of what we are doing and how it can help
    others.
-   Create a survey/form for people across Steno to submit ideas for
    projects or things we can help with, then we can start working on
    those one-by-one. And so we can start building up a wait list.
    -   **Action**: Luke will create this and advertise it
