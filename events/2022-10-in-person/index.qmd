## Sessions

We can discuss or ask questions anytime throughout the 2 days. They can
be on topic or off topic :smile:

### Onboarding {#onboarding}

For project:

-   Overview of SDCA:
    -   [Main Steno website](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research)
    -   [Common Docs](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/)
-   Overview of project:
    -   [GitHub
        repository](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/seedcase-project/)
    -   [Website](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/seedcase-project/)
-   Expectations:
    -   Autonomy, flexibility in work and hours
    -   Any side projects or other activities, maybe we can incorporate
        or help out
-   Tools critical to project:
    -   Necessary for project: Git, GitHub, git branch-based workflow,
        Quarto, Markdown
    -   Brainstorm later on for other necessary tools for whole team
        (e.g. communication)

### Social activities {#social-activities}

-   Walk around the area
-   Things to chat about:
    -   Things you'd like to learn while in this job/project
    -   How do you work best?
    -   Things learned from previous positions that worked well or could
        be improved on

### Working together {#working-together}

-   CONTRIBUTING
    -   Git branch-based workflow (GitHub)
    -   When do we work synchronously together and how often to do
        virtual meetings
        -   What to cover during meetings or co-working sessions?
-   GOVERNANCE
    -   How does overall decision making and responsibility structure
        look like? To communicate to others outside team how we do
        things. For instance, while I'm in general responsible for
        overall plan and structure of project, others can also be
        involved in decisions since those contributing also have a stake
        in the project.
-   CODE OF CONDUCT
    -   How do we want to work together and behave?
    -   How to resolve conflicts?
-   Tools to communicate with each other or for project management
    -   Which communication channels? (Discord/Slack/Zoom/etc)
    -   What tools to use to manage project? GitHub issues/board?
        Trello?

### Sharing knowledge and skills {#sharing}

-   How to share what we already know and what we learn?
    -   For those inside and outside the team?
    -   As blog posts? So we can eventually combine them into formal
        teaching material or some other documentation later?
    -   Other forms of dissemination?
    -   Improving each other with structured peer feedback sessions?
        (like I do with instructor peers)?
-   How to involve community (internal to SDCA as well as external)
    -   Needs to be a recurring topic
    -   How to actively and frequently do it? E.g. invite people to
        contribute or come to in-person meetings?
    -   "Stakeholder investigation"

### Project brainstorming {#brainstorming}

-   Brainstorm potential names and logos for project (other than DIF)
    -   Some ideas in Issue
        [#4](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/seedcase-project/issues/4#issuecomment-1114582527),
        like GRID?
-   Do we make a new GitHub organization or use steno-aarhus?
-   Delegating/assigning tasks and next steps
    -   Things to do between now and next virtual meeting?

### Next steps {#next-steps}

-   Next (virtual) session: Brainstorming architecture/design, list of
    tasks/milestones and who does what
-   Scheduling next session, when to do it?
-   Other items:
    -   Setting up travellers profile, other things to make planning
        these events easier.

## Minutes

### Contributing:

-   Can use CODEOWNERS to make explicit who is responsible for what code
    pieces
-   Describe copyright holder (AU), will need to contact them about this
-   Guidelines for writing commit messages
    -   Maybe an automatic checker?
-   Commit often for smaller pieces of code
-   Connect to issue in commit message (with `#NUMBER`)
-   PR code review
    -   Timebound? How long before merging?
        -   Maybe once a week?
    -   Smaller code changes per PR
-   "Meeting"-based code review
    -   Usually for bigger feature or bigger change to the code
        -   Maybe do it for a smaller milestone
        -   We can do something like this for the analysis
    -   Done on a PR that's big, and focus on the changed part of code
    -   Screen sharing if remote (which will be done usually)
        -   Or if in person, don't need a projector, can just do it on
            computer
    -   For now only need to do it within team, maybe later include
        others to disseminate skills/knowledge
    -   Look over the code before the meeting to best prepare for it
    -   Explain about the why of the code in a few minutes
-   Meetings
    -   Virtual:
        -   Weekly update, aim for short \~30 min
        -   Longer meeting for discussion and brainstorming of
            shorter/minor milestones, schedule when we need it
            -   Also for showing other "stakeholders" aka Annelli and
                Alisa
    -   In-person:
        -   Important stage to discuss next steps, bigger milestones
        -   When to schedule, not sure. Maybe use the in-person meetings
            as a "deadline" to push for finishing one milestone and to
            discuss the next milestone?
        -   Good to brainstorm and get into things more

### Governance

-   Simple for now, show who is on the team and their responsibilities
-   Decision making:
    -   Voting? Once we're larger scale.
        -   Indicative vote: To get feedback from community but
            ultimately can decide by team but justify if the decision is
            against the feedback
            -   And that it aligns with values/philosophy (as much as
                possible)
            -   Feature to vote on based on votes (through Issues or?)
        -   Vote based on willness to pay for it or some type of token?
            -   Each person can have a limited number of points (e.g.
                100 or 10 tokens), more points used for a given feature
            -   Maybe also add features based on if requester will fund
                it/invest in it
    -   For now, me and then soon will be team decisions.
    -   And also, if you want it, do it? Do rather than ask
        -   Like, the popularity of "addons", depends on extensibility
            of Seedcase
        -   We don't *have* to incorporate something if someone submits
            a PR, but we're more likely to if they do
-   TODO: Luke will start making it

### Code of Conduct

-   Use the standard template, we can add more to it if needed.
    -   When discussing (in general), focus on reasons and the
        beliefs/rationale for them, and avoid making the discussion
        personal.
-   To deal with potential conflicts:
    -   To resolve bigger conflicts within team, first Luke then go to
        Annelli
    -   If outside contributor (in violation of, or bordering it,
        Conduct)
        -   Give warning once (in good faith)
        -   Block after that
    -   If internal contributor (but not the team)
        -   First Luke, next go to Annelli (or Niels)

### Communication

-   Another option is Google Chat
-   Discord?
    -   Maybe better for longer term community
    -   We'll test out this option for now and reassess
    -   TODO: Create Discord server for DIF
-   Project management:
    -   JIRA? Cost? We can check it out
    -   Trello? Can we integrate with GitHub? Can it be public?
    -   Try out GitHub Project Board, reassess later

### Sharing knowledge and skills

-   Kris would be interested in doing webinars
    -   But also in making teaching materials
-   Informally share knowledge with demos during weekly meetings
    -   Of something we've found or learned
    -   But can schedule things in more detail at another day if there
        is interest
    -   And if we think if it would be useful for others, we can decide
        if we want to expand to others and how (e.g. use the Steno media
        room)
-   Can do short blogs on some new things, doesn't have to be much
    -   First blog could be how to make a blog post
-   Structured peer feedback
    -   May need to continually reassess how we implement this
    -   One "continue doing" piece of feedback, one to two "to improve"
        pieces
    -   Maybe at the end of in-person? Or once per year/half year?
    -   Make sure to have a strong moderator
    -   Emphasize neutral tone disagreement, continued with strong
        reasons
-   Kris and Annelli could be responsible for the "stakeholder
    investigation"
    -   Internal (or external) Steno
        -   Define who is the stakeholder here
        -   Start writing out who might be interested and group them
            together
        -   Plot on interest and influence scheme
            -   Manage low interest, high influence
            -   Each team member could plot them and see how they
                overlap
        -   Then make some strategies to:
            -   Keep engaged or only keep informed.
            -   Or how to engage those who we think might be important
                but are probably low interest (aka very busy), high
                influence (IT, security, upper management)
        -   Can also try to get more than just health people, also
            others like ecology etc
        -   Also incorporate focus groups to get their feedback on
            functionality they think they might need
            -   This will be later in the timeline
            -   And then afterwards can send out an email about general
                themes that were discussed
            -   Or thresholds/"red lines" we can't cross or must not
                have (for features)
                -   E.g. security, so might need to look into tools to
                    check security
        -   Might need to get feedback from security/privacy side early
            on
            -   [DPIA](https://gdpr.eu/data-protection-impact-assessment-template/),
                we might need that
            -   Maybe make sure to configure it in a way that it only
                works with DPIA compliant servers?

### Project brainstorming

-   Keep with steno-aarhus GitHub repo for now
-   Names:
    -   several ideas came up, related to seeds or nuts or scaffold or
        shell
    -   Most of our ideas were already taken by similar data/software
        type companies/projects
    -   Seedcase was one that we liked the most, we will use that one
        for now
-   Tasks:
    -   Start adding issues and project (Luke)
    -   Write out value and philosophy (Luke)
    -   Look through other open source projects and see how their values
        and missions, and see how we can overlap (Kris)
    -   Mapping out different databases that are available (Kris)
    -   Map out other container software (Richard)
    -   Why we use container software for project (Richard)
-   Misc topics:
    -   Visualizing the underlying database:
        -   Lucy Charts for making diagrams (of databases)
            -   Is there a CLI for something like that for visualizing
                data inside Seedcase?
        -   Graph Database? Focus on visualizing the database
            -   Similar product is Neo4J?
    -   Unit testing
        -   "White-box testing": Test all code inside package
        -   "Gray-box testing": Test user facing functions, e.g. testing
            mostly the API/function
        -   "Black-box testing": Testing UI, pretending to be the User
            -   That's something we'll probably have to hire out?
    -   Authentication:
        -   Through eduroam/WAYF module?
        -   Generic module to allow companies to modify to add there own
            thing?
        -   What about for those outside of Denmark?
        -   Authentication can be added optionally

### Next steps

-   Richard could come every \~3 month for in person meetings
-   Next virtual Dec. 16th 1030-1330
-   At some point need to get Richard a traveler account?
    -   Need to ask Charlotte about doing plane tickets for Richard...?

### Misc ideas:

-   For next session, do input/output schematic showing functions etc
    when brainstorming, sketched out
-   Audience:
    -   Two of them: users and contributors
    -   Different "pitches" and documentation for different audience
