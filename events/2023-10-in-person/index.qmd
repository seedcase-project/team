## Sessions

### Workshop with Mjølner

- They will lead these two days.

### Next steps, barriers, and other items

-   Areas of struggle or barriers?
    - Discussion on why progress has been slow.
    - What are some things we need to improve on?
- Idea for team workflow: 
    - Focused work on individual projects on a rotation basis. For example, one month is on `seedcase-registry`, another is on `team`. We could rotate between one month core activity followed by a two week focus on smaller projects (like volunteer database).
