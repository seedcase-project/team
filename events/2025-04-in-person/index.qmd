## Sessions

All brainstorming sessions start with some dedicated individual time to
think and write down thoughts, then we will discuss them all together.

The debrief, retrospective, and planning are the usual ones we do, so
there is nothing needed to explain or describe about it here.

### Brainstorming on versioning

::: callout-note
We may (or may not!) do the versioning after first uploading to PyPI, so
maybe a short iteration or two on that after the next two milestones.
:::

This brainstorming is very open-ended, though I do have some ideas about
it. But would be good to get different thoughts and perspectives around
versioning data. Here is a unfiltered list of some things that have been
in my head:

-   Versioning of data (e.g. `v0.1.0`), Frictionless recommends SemVer,
    is that good enough?
-   Tracking changes to data... ideas on how? Do it, or not?
-   Tracking of changes in general? Explicitly recommend using Git
    and/or make functions in Sprout that integrate with Git?
-   If we track data, only track data in `batch/`? What about
    downloaded/ingested/raw?
-   If we track, we'd have to figure out what tool. DVC, Git LFS, etc?
    (We probably can't answer that during these meetings).
-   How to do CHANGELOG? Do we automate it like we do with commitizen or
    do we include it as part of Sprout?
-   What is versioning based on? When is something a version update?
-   How to handle commits, what are the names of the commits? Make use
    of conventional commits?
-   Use tags for versions? How to handle tags? How do DVC and Git LFS
    handle tags (not sure we can answer that, but something to
    consider)?
-   How might that be implemented on e.g. GenomeDK or Denmark
    Statistics?

### Discussions about ON-LiMiT

We'll meet with Daniel Ibsen to discuss the ON-LiMiT collaboration,
where he'll share some updates and we can get into some details about
how we will work together.

The debrief sessions will be going over the chat we had and discussing
what we think about it. Depending on what we chat about, we could have a
lot to discuss here that could get into some practical details and
brainstorming. But really depends on what happens in the chat.

Some things we might discuss in the meeting debrief:

-   Thinking how Sprout will fit in with downloading/inputting different
    sources of data, coming from, e.g. RedCap, "FitBit" type watches.
-   Using GenomeDK for data storage (is Linux server), how that will fit
    with our potential workflows around using Sprout.
-   How would we like to work together? What are our wants?

These discussions will also have some connections to what we will do
with DP-Next, so we may talk about that project too.
