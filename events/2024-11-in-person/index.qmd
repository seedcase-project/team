## Details

-   Informal dinner on Nov 27 and full team dinner on Nov 28.
-   **Main aims**:
    -   Understand each other on more personal levels (related to work
        and Seedcase).
    -   Not to focus too much on technical aspects, but more on human
        and social aspects.
    -   Become informed about other projects that we might collaborate
        with and how we can contribute.

## Schedule

The schedule is meant as a **guide only**. We might spend more time on
some topics and less on others.

## Sessions

All brainstorming sessions start with some dedicated individual time to
think and write down thoughts, then we will discuss them all together.

Maybe use stickies to write down thoughts and then discuss them?

### Align understandings about the current state of Seedcase

**Aim**: Make sure we are all aligned with what we are building and why
and for who and what it might look like.

-   It seems like there is a bit of a drift in understanding of what
    we're doing, why, and how. So this is some dedicated time to assess
    how we all understand things and take some time to update and
    discuss it.
-   Discuss and brainstorm how Seedcase will look like in the end and
    how users might interact with it.
-   Start broad with all of Seedcase, then slowly focus in on Sprout and
    it's subcomponents.
-   Lastly, Luke share his broader vision for Seedcase.

### Personal goals and perspectives of what we create

**Aim**: Brainstorm, share, and discuss our own personal goals and
perspectives on what we create and do when working on Seedcase. This is
mainly to help us understand each other better and to help us support
each other in working with our strengths, interests, and passions.

-   Write out and share how we each would like to see Seedcase develop
    in the next few years *and* what we would like to work on over that
    time.
-   Brainstorm what we can do to support and encourage these goals and
    perspectives in our work.

### Roadmap, deliverables, and milestones

**Aim**: To agree on and set the priority of each deliverable and level
of interest in working on it, so that we can set the order we want to
work on them.

1.  Review updates to roadmap in pull request
    [seedcase-project/community#67](https://github.com/seedcase-project/community/pull/67).
2.  Decide on the priorities for them and interest in each, then sort
    them.
3.  Review the deliverables at the top of the list we sorted, then
    discuss and agree on milestones for them and what we might (very
    roughly) estimate for a timeline.

### Overview of progress and current status

**Aim**: Discuss where we are at and what we've done in order to connect
with previous sessions.

-   What we've achieved so far and how close we are to an minimum viable
    product (MVP).
-   Discuss any barriers and challenges, both individually and as a
    team.
    -   Brainstorm ways we can work to resolve them.
-   How does the progress and current status, as well as the challenges
    and barriers, align with the goals and perspectives we just
    discussed?

### Presentations/updates

-   Status update to Annelli:
    -   Broad overview of current state and status.
    -   Review main deliverables and a general overview of the roadmap.
    -   General update on what we've done in the year (e.g. with
        Mj√∏lner).
    -   Share any challenges and barriers we've had.
    -   Share how we intend to showcase our work to people (e.g. with
        data showcases and guide).
    -   Any future plans (collaboration projects).
-   Presentations on ON-LiMiT and DP-Next projects:
    -   **Aim**: Learn about new projects, what their needs are, and how
        we can contribute.
    -   ON-LiMiT by Daniel Ibsen (\~15 min).
    -   [DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io/) by Daniel Witte (\~15
        min).
    -   Seedcase by us :relaxed: (\~15 min).
    -   Discuss their needs and how we can contribute (\~60 min).

## Minutes

::: callout-warning
I had forgotten to write these minutes out after the meeting, so there
are some things that I might have missed or forgotten. In general, these
meetings were more about aligning our understandings and discussing our
overall goals and aspirations, so there were fewer concrete minutes to
take.
:::

-   We spent a good amount of time aligning what we understood we were
    building towards. Then agreeing on what we each individually wanted
    to be doing and working on. In the end, we all felt more aligned and
    understood each other better.
-   We trimmed down many of the potential deliverables to ones we wanted
    to work on, moved several into "potential/interested" and kept only
    a few in "will do" or "doing" categories. We also went over and
    agreed that more detailed roadmaps would be on the GitHub Project
    [Long-term
    Planning](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/22/views/1)
    board.
-   Our meetings with ON-LiMiT and DP-Next were very helpful and
    informative. Since they both are early in their development, we
    don't have any tangible actions, expectations, or deliverables yet.
    But we do plan on collaborating and revisiting these
    discussions in future meetings.
