## Welcome to Seedcase

If you landed on this post, you are most likely a new team member on the Seedcase project. Welcome!

To get you started, there are some first steps you'll need to do and some posts to for you to read and review.

## First steps

1. **Send your GitHub username and Discord username to the Team Leader**
    - We use Discord as our communication platform and this way so you can be added to the Seedcase Project server asap. If you don't have a Discord account, you can go to [discord.com](https://discord.com) and create one.
    - You will need to be added to the SDCA and Seedcase organizaions (and potentially other repositories) on GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create one.
2. **Set up GitHub two-factor authentication (2FA)**
    - See [this post](github.md) (you will need 2FA to access the Seedcase repositories)
3. **Order IT equipment**
    - Talk to the Team Leader about which IT equipment you will need (e.g., computer, mouse, keyboard, and dock station) and Team Leader will help you with ordering it.

## Posts to read and review

In the Seedcase project, we practice a "documentation first" culture. This means that when you read through posts, we encourage you to create issues and pull requests, when you stumble upon something that's unclear or information that's missing or outdated.

Therefore, before you start to read and review the pages in the list below, we encourage you to read the following posts
with introductions and guidelines to our workflows:

1. [Documentation First Culture](https://seedcase-project.org/community/guide-entries/documentation-first/)
2. [Workflows for adding content](workflow.md)
3. If you will need to add new posts: [Adding posts](https://seedcase-project.org/community/guide-entries/adding-posts/) (this post contains guidelines on that)

Now that you have read the above, you can review the pages below:

1. [Onboarding SDCA website](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/onboarding.html)
    - This website is for general onboarding at SDCA and covers general onboarding, such as the general code of conduct and details on varous social activities and events
    - Any subpages of particular interest? Maybe "Welcome and getting started (as a PhD student?)", "General practicalities" and "IT basics"?  
2. [Our Seedcase Team Docs website](https://team.seedcase-project.org/) (which is where this post is located)
    - This website covers the documentation, contributing guidelines, onboarding material, and event details/agendas for the Seedcase Project team
3. [General contributing guidelines website](https://seedcase-project.org/community/contributing)
    - This website covers the contributing guidelines of the Seedcase project
    - Potentially start with the "Decisions" section, describing *why* we choose to use the tools that we use: [Why Discord?](https://seedcase-project.org/community/decisions/why-discord/) and [Why Quarto?](https://seedcase-project.org/community/decisions/why-quarto/)
    - Then go to the [individual guide entries](https://seedcase-project.org/community/contributing) covering guidelines for contributing
4. [Design documentation](https://seedcase-project.org/design/)
    - The design documentation covers stakeholders, design decisions, software architecture, data architecture, and more.

If something is unclear to you, you are more than welcome to reach out to the other team members on Discord. We'll love to help you out.

## Software

When you have received your IT equipment, there are some software you'll need to install. Go to the [Software we use](software.md) post.
