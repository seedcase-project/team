# Welcome to Seedcase! 
If you landed on this post, you are most likely a new team member on the Seedcase project. Welcome! :o) 

To get you started, there are some things you need to do and some posts to for you to read/review. 
...

## Things to do: 
1. Get Discord account and send username to Team Leader (so you can be added to the Seedcase Project server)
2. Send GitHub username to Team Leader (so you can be added to the SDCA and Seedcase organizaions and relevant repositories)
3. Set up GitHub two-factor authentication (2FA): See *this post* -> entries/github (you will need 2FA to access the Seedcase repositories)
4. Talk to Team Leader about which IT equipment will need to be ordered (e.g., computer, mouse, keyboard, dock station)

## Posts to read/review:
In this project, we practice a ["documentation first" culture](https://seedcase-project.org/community/guide-entries/documentation-first/). This means that when you read through posts, we encourage you to create issues (and pull requests), if you believe something isn't clear, or if information is missing or outdated.

1. [Onboarding SDCA website](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/onboarding.html)

    - Any subpages of particular interest? Maybe "Welcome and getting started (as a PhD student?)", "General practicalities" and "IT basics"?

    - Then go to the [individual guide entries](https://seedcase-project.org/community/contributing) covering guidelines for contributing
