title: "Time-constrained iterative workflow"

We take inspiration from some aspects of [Agile Software
Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and
[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module), especially this idea
of time-boxed periods ("iterations") of work that follow a specific pattern and process
for incrementally building or improving things. An iteration for us follows
this general sequence of steps:

- Team lead creates a GitHub Project Board for the upcoming iteration using the ["Iteration" template](https://github.com/orgs/seedcase-project/projects/4).
    - Team lead will add the aim and output to be discussed and decided on in the first meeting.
- The first meeting of the iteration, which we aim to be no more than an hour, is to discuss and plan the specifics of the iteration.
    - Before the first meeting, review the aim and output of the iteration board and then write out potential tasks that we would need to do to complete the output.
    - During the meeting, decide on the end output (the "increment" or "milestone").
    - During the meeting, brainstorm and write out more tasks that are needed to complete the increment or milestone, or select them from the existing list of tasks. A task is a GitHub Issue.
    - Each team member self-assigns themselves to a task (self-assign to Issue) and estimates the time spent on them by using the Iteration's Roadmap Board.
    - Decide on how long the iteration should or will take and set a date for the "last iteration meeting".
- Throughout the iteration, we will:
    - Have our [update meetings](update-meetings.md) to discuss progress, next steps, and any struggles or barriers (with the work or the iteration/process).
    - Work on their assigned tasks
    - Review Pull Requests from others
    - Add more Issues if required. If the Issue is relevant to the current iteration, then add it to the Project Board so that we can determine who will self-assign it during one of our meetings. If the Issue isn't relevant, don't add it to the Project Board, and we will save it for future iterations to work on. 
    - Comment in Issues or Pull Requests if tagged or if we have something to add to the discussion.
- The final iteration's meeting, which we aim to be no more than an hour long, is the debrief meeting to discuss:
    - How things went and what could be improved in the process.
    - Barriers encountered that we should address for next time.
