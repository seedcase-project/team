title: "Communication across team and collaborators"
---

Our general philosophy regarding communication is described in more
detail in the page on [Documentation-First Culture](). Our within-team
philosophy is:

-   Limit meetings as much as is necessary, excluding our [weekly
    update](update-meetings.md) meetings
    -   Hold a meeting if we require a more active and dynamic
        discussion and eventual decision on something
    -   Always include an agenda as well as minutes afterwards
    -   Limit the time to what is reasonably required to come to a
        decision
    -   Assign people to chair/faciliator role and to notetaking role
-   Limit emails as much as is necessary, unless communication is with
    someone external to our team or requires a more formal written
    record for potential audit purposes
-   Use our Discord channel for shorter, informal, or quick questions or
    comments
-   Use a GitHub Issue for longer discussions that require more thought
    and consideration from other team members and that are tied to a
    more concrete actionable item
-   Write a blog post (in the relevant location) when the information
    would be useful for future purposes or people, such as sharing
    knowledge or for a decision that was made or for a contributing
    guideline

No matter which written communication channel we use, we write in
Markdown format, though Discord uses a limited set of Markdown features.
