## Git tags and releases

With the Seedcase product, Git tags and releases are/will be added
fairly regularly. On the other hand, with the website, we only tag a
version of the website after a major "milestone" or deadline. For
instance, after sending the design documents to get reviewed or when
sending an update document to our funder or stakeholders.
