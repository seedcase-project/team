title: "Code review meetings"

---

This *optional* meeting is to go over and discuss code if any team
member has anything to discuss, share, or need help with making a
decision.

If necessary or interested, a team member will go over some code that is
preferably, but not required, in an existing and open Pull Request. It
can be in a draft format and doesn't need to be completed.

During this meeting, we'll try limit the time to \~30 minutes and *at
most* review two Pull Requests, with 15 minutes for each PR.

More details about this type of meeting will be added as we practice and
do them.
