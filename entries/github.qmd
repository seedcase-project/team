## Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA)

We of course use GitHub for our work, so as a team member or contributor
you need to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join/). Since you
will likely also have access to our repositories to write and modify
content, we need to consider potential for security risks of your
account being compromised and impacts on our work. While we
organizationally have settings in place to minimize that risk, we
individually need to have security features in place.

For that reason, all internal contributors need to set up 2FA on their
GitHub account. Follow the steps within this [GitHub
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
to set it up. While GitHub doesn't explicitly recommend any specific
time-based one-time password (TOTP) apps, good ones are [Google
Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&ref_topic=2954345&sjid=1964065568409601298-EU)
or [Microsoft
Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/security/mobile-authenticator-app).
