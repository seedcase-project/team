title: "Weekly update meetings"
---

While we try to limit meetings as much as is appropriate, we do have
weekly update meetings. We draw inspiration from ["daily
scrums"](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum) to keep
each other updated on what everyone else is doing. Except, instead of
daily, we have them weekly. These are some guidelines on running these
update meetings:

-   Keep meeting to \~30 minute
-   Each person gives an \~5 minute update that answers these items, in
    this order:
    1.  What did you do since the last update?
    2.  What are some challenges or blocks you faced and is there
        anything the team can do to help?
    3.  What do you plan to do until the next update meeting?
-   Avoid getting into too much detail about any particular topic. See
    the guide entry on [communication](communication.md) about
    alternatives to these types of discussions.
