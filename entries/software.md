## Recommended VS Code Extensions 
If you are not familiar with VS Code extensions, they are add-ons or plugins that enhance the 
functionality of VS Code. They can be installed to customize and extend the capabilities of 
VS Code to support a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and development tasks.

Go to the extensions tab in VS Code and search for the following extensions:

-   Quarto (to enable the preview of qmd files within VS Code)
    -   To use this extension, you will need to download [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) 
-   PlantUML (to enable the preview of puml diagrams)
-   Dev Containers??

**Python Extensions** (*draft* - Signe have used these earlier)

-   python
-   isort 
-   Black Formatter 
-   autoDocstring 
-   mypy
-   ruff 
-   pylance
