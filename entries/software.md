    -   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    -   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) (not the
        Professional version)

These are the recommended helper or workflow type software:

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

If you are using VS Code, but are not familiar with extensions, they are add-ons or plugins
that enhance the functionality of VS Code. They can be installed to customize and extend the
capabilities of VS Code to support a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and
development tasks.

In the [extensions.json](https://github.com/seedcase-project/seedcase-project/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json)
in the seedcase-project repository, you will find the extensions we recommend for working
in that workspace. When you clone the seedcase-project repository and open the repository
folder in VS Code, a pop-up message will recommend the extensions in this file.
We recommend that you install these.

which should be recommended here)
