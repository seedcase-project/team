## Recommended VS Code Extensions 
If you are not familiar with VS Code extensions, they are add-ons or plugins that enhance the 
functionality of VS Code. They can be installed to customize and extend the capabilities of 
VS Code to support a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and development tasks.

Go to the extensions tab in VS Code and search for the following extensions:

-   [Quarto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) (to enable preview the website)
    -   To use this extension, you will need to download [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
